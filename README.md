# lsl-slack-relay
An extremely simple LSL -> Slack relay.

This project is just an example of how you can use LSL's [JSON functions](http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Json_usage_in_LSL) and [llHTTPRequest()](http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/LlHTTPRequest) to easily send a message to Slack.

You will need an [Incoming Webhook](https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks) from Slack for this to work. Replace the fake URL in this code with your real one, and you should be off and running!

This code is in the public domain. Use it to do whatever you wish! If you do come up with something cool using it, I'd love to know about it! I like seeing LSL used in fun ways. :)
